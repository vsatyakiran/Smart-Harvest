# Smart-Harvest
It is a crop recommendation and fertilizer recommendation system, which is developed using machine learning algorithms made our team @Butcher2004 win **"Hack2Impact"** Hackthon , which is intercollege hackthon where 38 teams participated from 6 different colleges and universities.

Main code is available in app.py file and model training code is in app.ipynb.
The dataset I have used is [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset). We have trianed the data with different ml and dl algorithms which includes `SVM`, `Logistic Regression`, ensembling methods like `RandomForestClassifier`, `DecisionTreeClassifier` also we tried `ANN`. The results and accuracy of the models can been seen in the bottom of the readme file.

## User Input
When user enters the `zipcode` of his/her loaction weather details will be automatically filled where as **Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Posttasium, pH** of soil has to be given by the user.

## Resuts of the crop recommendation
These will be results of the crop recommendation, we are recommendting top five crops that can be grown on that soil which have the specitic attributes.

## Details of 22 Crops
We have scraped the data fron the official website, which consists details , how each crop can be grown , what are the fertilizers has to be used, what must be the soil fertility and duration of the crop.

# Fertilizer Recommandations
We are recommanding the **natural fertilizers** like compost, manure for the specific soil with Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Pottasium and for the crop the user wanted to grow.
