    "'Watermelon':{\n",
    "    'Duration':'Typically, watermelons take about 80 to 100 days from planting to harvest. However, this can vary depending on the variety of watermelon and environmental conditions.',\n",
    "    'Environment':{\n",
    "        'Rainfall':'Watermelons require adequate but well-drained soil and consistent moisture. Ideally, they need around 20-30 inches of rainfall throughout the growing season. However, irrigation may be necessary in regions with insufficient rainfall.',\n",
    "        'Temperatue':'Watermelons thrive in warm temperatures. The optimal temperature range for watermelon growth is between 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C) during the day and above 50°F (10°C) at night.',\n",
    "        'Humidity':'Watermelons prefer moderate humidity levels ranging from 60% to 80%.',\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    'Soil':{\n",
    "        'Nitrogen':'Watermelons have a moderate to high nitrogen requirement. Soil should have a nitrogen content of about 50-100 lbs per acre for optimal growth.',\n",
    "        'Phoshorous':'Adequate phosphorus is crucial for root development and fruit production. Soil should contain approximately 40-80 lbs per acre of phosphorus.',\n",
    "        'Potassiun':'Potassium helps in fruit development and overall plant health. Soil should have around 100-150 lbs per acre of potassium.',\n",
    "        'ph':'Watermelons prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.',\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    'Cultivate':{\n",
    "        'Site selection': 'Choose a site with well-drained soil and ample sunlight exposure.',\n",
    "        'Soil preparation': 'Till the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches and incorporate organic matter like compost for improved fertility and drainage.',\n",
    "        'Planting': 'Sow watermelon seeds directly into the prepared soil or transplant seedlings after the last frost date. Space seeds or seedlings 2-3 feet apart in rows spaced 6-8 feet apart.',\n",
    "        'Watering': 'Provide consistent moisture, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages. Water deeply and regularly, aiming to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged.',\n",
    "        'Fertilization': 'Apply fertilizer according to soil test recommendations before planting and side-dress with additional nitrogen and potassium fertilizer during the growing season as needed.',\n",
    "        'Weed control': 'Keep the area around watermelon plants free from weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and water.',\n",
    "        'Pest and disease management': 'Monitor plants regularly for signs of pests and diseases and take appropriate measures such as using organic pesticides or practicing crop rotation to prevent infestations.',\n",
    "        'Support': 'Consider providing support for the developing fruit by using trellises or slings to prevent them from touching the ground and reduce the risk of rot.',\n",
    "        'Harvesting':'Watermelons are ready for harvest when the tendrils near the stem turn brown, and the underside of the fruit turns creamy yellow. Harvest by cutting the stem with a sharp knife, leaving a few inches attached to the fruit.'\n",
